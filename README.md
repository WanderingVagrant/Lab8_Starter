1. (1.) because this way the test truly is automated and runs to check whether all code pushed is stable or not. It also runs often enough to catch any errors as wel develop, without being a hassle for developers.
2. (No) because E2E testing is meant to check complex actions by the user interacting with the webpage, and is mainly concerned with the UI and the DOM. Testing a single function would be easier and more efficient with one or more unit tests.
3. No because the message feature will involve a lot of functions with many moving parts, and it could succeed/fail in a large variety of ways throughout its execution. A unit test in this case would not be able to tell you much.
4. Yes, mac-message length is a small part of the messaging application with very few ways to to fail. Therefore a unit test would be very helpful in debugging and testing this singular feature.
